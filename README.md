# EvoCRTMul
EvoCRTMul is a compiler and hardware generator specialized in the synthesis of ultra-efficient digital multipliers. The central approach breaks down N-bit multiplication into independent submodules using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and the Residue Number System (RNS), allowing each channel to be individually optimized through Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP).
